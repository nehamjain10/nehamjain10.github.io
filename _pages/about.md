I am currently a final year undergraduate student at the Indian Institure of Technology, Madras where I am currently associated with the Computational Imaging Lab.  I am interested in the fields of Computational Photography, Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

I spent the summer of 2022 working at Adobe Research on developing counterfactual explanations for recommender systems. I've also been fortunate to be work with some amazing mentors, including [Prof. Kaushik Mitra](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/), [Prof. Aswin Sankarnarayanan](http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~saswin/) and  [Dr. Gaurav Sinha](https://sinhagaurav.github.io/).
