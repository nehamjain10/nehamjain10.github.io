# About Me

<img src="https://nehamjain10.github.io/images/neham.jpg" class="floatpic">

Hi! I'm **Neham Jain**, a Research Engineer at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/).

I graduated with a **Master of Science in Robotics** from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) (GPA: 4.11/4.0), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ioannis Gkioulekas](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~igkioule/). Prior to CMU, I earned my **Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering** from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) (CGPA: 9.24/10) with a Minor in Machine Learning.

My research focuses on **3D Computer Vision**, **Deep Learning Systems**, and **Robotic Perception**. I'm particularly interested in 3D Gaussian Splatting, neural rendering, and building scalable ML infrastructure.

Feel free to reach out to me at **nehamjain2002 [at] gmail.com**
