I am a Master of Science in Robotics student at **Carnegie Mellon University**, advised by **Prof. Ioannis Gkioulekas**. I completed my Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering at **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras** with a minor in Machine Learning.

My research interests lie in the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Computer Graphics**, and **Machine Learning**, with a focus on 3D reconstruction, rendering, and generative models.

Previous to my masters, I have interned at **Meta Reality Labs**, **Adobe Research**, and **Subex AI Labs**.
