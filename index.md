# About Me

Here is **Neham Jain**.<br>

I am a Research Engineer at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), where I work on data pipelines for training embodied AI agents. My research focuses on **3D Computer Vision**, **Neural Rendering**, and **Deep Learning Systems**.

I graduated with a **Master of Science in Robotics** from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) in May 2025 (GPA: 4.11/4.0), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ioannis Gkioulekas](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~igkioule/) and [Prof. Sebastian Scherer](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/sebastian-scherer/). My thesis was titled *"SmokeSeer: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Smoke Removal and Scene Reconstruction"*.

Prior to CMU, I earned my **Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering** from [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) (CGPA: 9.24/10) with a Minor in Machine Learning.

I am always open to academic discussions and potential collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at **nehamjain2002 [at] gmail.com**
