*   **Embody3D: large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset for training embodied AI agents**
    *   *arXiv 2025*
    *   [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16258)
    *   Built QA tools, coordinated annotation of 1.6M videos, and curated 500 hours of high-quality data.

*   **3D Gaussian splatting for reconstruction of wildfire scenes**
    *   *3DV 2026 Poster*
    *   [[Project Page]](https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/smokeseer/)
    *   Decomposed wildfire scenes into smoke and surface Gaussians for smoke-free rendering.

## 2024

*   **Counterfactual Explanations of Visual Recommender Systems**
    *   *WWW 2024*
    *   [[Paper]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589335.3651484)
    *   Computed the minimal meaningful perturbation to an item’s image-embedding that would remove it from a user’s recommended list.

## 2022

*   **Towards Realistic Underwater Dataset Generation and Color Restoration**
    *   *arXiv 2022*
    *   [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14821)
    *   Created a **multimodal domain adaptation (GANs)** technique to create a dataset for **different water conditions**.
    *   Existing **algorithms** trained on our **dataset** attained superior performance on underwater **image restoration** task.
