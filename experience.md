## Meta Reality Labs | Research Engineer
**June 2025 - Present | Pittsburgh, PA**

*   **[Embody3D](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16258) dataset release**: Built QA tools, coordinated annotation of **1.6M videos**, and curated **500 hours** of high-quality data. Received **187 GitHub stars**, **3 citations**, and was adopted by internal teams for training.
*   Built **automated quality filtering** algorithms to eliminate annotation bottlenecks and ensure high-quality data for training.
*   Achieved **75% reduction** in tracking error rate by designing a **self-supervised data generation** to train keypoint model.

## Adobe Research | Research Engineer Intern
**Summer 2024 | San Francisco, CA**

*   **Scalable Pipeline for Training 3D Foundation Models**: Created a pipeline to convert **synthetic mesh assets** into **relightable Gaussian Splats**.
*   Wrote **custom CUDA kernels** to replace **spherical harmonics** with **neural features** for **relightability** and **faster training**.
*   Scaled the training pipeline to 32 nodes and **improved training time** from **6 minutes** per asset to **30 seconds**.

## Adobe Research | Research Scientist Intern
**Summer 2022 | Bangalore, India**

*   **Counterfactual Explanations of Visual Recommender Systems** ([Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589335.3651484))
*   Worked on counterfactual explanations for recommendation systems based on vision language models.
*   Computed the **minimal meaningful perturbation** to an item’s image-embedding that would remove it from a user’s recommended list. Used **CLIP** to connect image features to textual labels.
*   Work was accepted at **WWW 2024** and a **patent** has been filed at USPTO.

## Subex AI Labs | Machine Learning Intern
**Summer 2021 | Bangalore, India**

*   **Information extraction from unstructured invoices**: Developed an end to end pipeline for **multilingual invoice understanding** and **table extraction** using object detection.
*   Fine-tuned a **multimodal document transformer** model (**Layout-LMv2**) to extract form fields using **token classification**.
